The following notation and terminology conventions are used through this
thesis.

-   $p, q$: Probability distributions

-   $X_i$: Random variable, generally corresponding to a single node in
    a graph

-   $x_i$: Value assume by random variable $X_i$

-   $\mathbf{X},\mathbf{x}$: Set of all variables $\{X_i\}$, and
    possible values $\{x_i\}$ respectively

-   $\mathcal{D}$: Number of variables in the model

-   $N_i$: Number of settings variable $X_i$ can take

-   $d$: Unnormalised probability distribution

-   $Z$: Normalisation constant for MRFs, defined as
    $Z = \sum_{\mathbf{x}}\prod_{c\in\cl{G}} \phi_c(\mathbf{x}_c)$

-   $\phi$: Potential function, generally associated with a single
    max-clique or cluster in a graph

-   $\scope{(\phi)}$: The set of variables of which $\phi$ is a function

-   $\cl{(G)}$: The set of max-cliques in undirected graph $G$

-   $r$: Total number of terms in the tensor rank decomposition of
    $\phi$

-   $w_k$: Weight of the $k^\textrm{th}$ rank-one term in the
    decomposition for $\phi$, equal to the probability of drawing this
    term during sampling

-   $\psi_k$: The $k^\textrm{th}$ rank-one term in the decomposition for
    $\phi$; representing a fully-factorised function with the same scope
    as $\phi$

-   $\psi_{k,j}$: The $j^\textrm{th}$ vector in the set of vectors that
    make up $\psi_k$; representing a single factor of $\psi_k$

-   $\m{t}{s}$: Message from node $t$ to node $s$ in the belief
    propagation or junction tree algorithms

-   $K$: Number of rank-one terms sampled when computing approximate
    multiplications in tensor propagation

-   $H$: Threshold of terms above which we use approximate
    multiplication in our algorithm, versus exact multiplication

-   $M$: Maximum value of all rank-one tensors encountered in a complete
    execution of tensor propagation

-   $B$: Minimum expected value among all rank-one decompositions
    encountered in a complete execution of tensor propagation

-   $C$: Total number of cliques in an MRF

-   $Q$: Number of nodes in a junction tree

-   $T$: Induced width of a junction tree.
